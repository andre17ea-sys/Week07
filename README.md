# Week07 Assignment - 

This project is a simple event management application that allows users to view a list of events and add their own events.

## Features

- **View all events**: Users can see a list of events with details such as title, date.
- **Add events**: Users can contribute by submitting new events through a form. Submitted events are stored in the database and displayed dynamically.  
- **Responsive design**: The app is styled with CSS to look good on both desktop and mobile devices.  
- **Basic routing**: React is used to manage different pages, including a homepage, events page, and individual event pages.  



## Challenges

One of the main challenges in this project was handling **fetch errors and connecting the frontend with Supabase**. I spent a lot of time debugging API calls and ensuring that the frontend could correctly communicate with the backend. There were also small hurdles in styling the pages and making sure the responsive layout worked well across different devices.
